# Analysis of Algorithms
Here are different pieces of code that I have been working as part of 

 * Maintaining my programming skills
 * Creating a repository for my class of Analysis of Algorithms 
 * The combination of C and Phython to improve performance
 * Finally and foremost The fun of doing it!!!

I have the classics in c++ and python:

* Binary Trees
* Binary Search Trees
* AVLTrees
* Hash Tables
* Counting sort
* Quicksort using Tail Recursion

But I have been adding some testing of using ctypes and python

* cmult 
    * It contains some of my first efforts to understand how to connect ndarrays with pointers in c
* InsertionSort 
    * It uses a ndarray to work the insertion sort algorithm
