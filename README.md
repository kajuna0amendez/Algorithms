# Explanation
Here are different pieces of code that I have been working as part of my practices to mantain skills in algorithms in C++
It is sometimes sad to realized that you stop programming a lot in the academic setup... Thus these are my attempts to try to mantain those skills.

I have the classics:

* Binary Trees
* Hash Tables
* Quicksort using Tail Recursion
